optimizer idea:

new visitor extender return booleans
	expression that is direct child of command visiten
	only true at that expression if it is useful (its children return true)

direct expressions that are useless (such as 35;) can be omitted
build new parserrulecontext (parsetree implementation) from the useful nodes

only generate code from the new builded tree
